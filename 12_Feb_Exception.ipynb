    "An exception in Python is a mistake that happens while a programme is being run. An exception is reported when an error happens, interrupting the program's regular flow and allowing the programme to catch and manage it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can happen for a number of causes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Syntax errors\n",
    "2. Logical errors\n",
    "3. Runtime errors,  such as division by zero or accessing a non-existent variable\n",
    "Python provides a mechanism to catch and handle exceptions using a try-except block. The code that might raise an exception is put inside the try block, and the code to handle the exception is put inside the except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions and syntax errors are both types of errors that can occur in Python, but they have different causes and characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the syntax rules of the language. These errors are detected during the parsing stage of the program, before the code is executed. Syntax errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code, such as misspelling a keyword, forgetting a parenthesis, or using an incorrect operator. A syntax error will prevent the code from running at all and will need to be corrected before the program can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program when an unexpected condition or situation arises. Exceptions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input data, network problems, or insufficient resources. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions are not necessarily caused by mistakes in the code. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program using a try-except block."
